    This is my journey as a kid growing up
</h2>
<P>
    My name is Raymond and i come from Africa and the land of my ancestors, and now i live in canada
    the welcoming country, where i learn, live and play.
    
    The fact about what i like here is the food.
    I like burgers and tacos, i came here when i was 3 years old, and i dont like it when mom gave me
    food from africa because it does not taste good as the food here 
</P>

    Guru and i love playing video games.
